#' Function to detect year transitions and calculate cumulative age
#' of model results
#' 
#' Takes the result of iterative growth modeling and
#' transforms data from Julian Day (0 - 365) to cumulative
#' day of the shell age by detecting where transitions
#' from one year to the next occur and adding full years
#' (365 days) to simulations in later years.
#' @param resultarray Array containing the full results of
#' the optimized growth model
#' @param threshold Artificial threshold value used to recognize
#' peaks in occurrences of year transitions (default = 5)
#' @param plotyearmarkers Should the location of identified year
#' transitions be plotted? \code{TRUE/FALSE}
#' @return A new version of the resultarray with Julian Day model 
#' estimates replaced by estimates of cumulative age of the record
#' in days.
