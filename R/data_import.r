#' Function to import d18O data and process yearmarkers and calculation windows
#' 
#' Takes the name of a file that is formatted according to the standard format
#' and converts it to an object to be used later in the model. In doing so, the
#' function also reads the user-provided yearmarkers in the file and uses them
#' as a basis for the length of windows used throughout the model. This ensures
#' that windows are not too short and by default contain at least one year of
#' growth for modelling.
#' 
#' @param file_name Name of the file that contains d18O data
#' @return A list containing an object with the original data and details on
#' the position and length of modelling windows
